# Turbulence Modelling
This simple repository constains 2 things for solving the assignment:
- InputCalc.m, for processing the CFD data compared to the reference data. The input data is the "u_inp_cfd" value, which is changed when required.
- .jou files, for submitting the ANSYS files to CRESCENT2 HPC environment.
